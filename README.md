## Goal
In this notebook we wanted to implement some functionalities to analyze a weighted graph only by using algorithms implemented from scratch. In the functionalities are also embedded plots to visualize the results.

## Overwiev

1. Building the graphs
2. Overall informations of a graph
3. Centrality measures (Beetweenness, Degree Centrality, Closeness, Page Rank)
4. Shortest paths (Djikstra)
5. Cutting a graph (BFS, DFS, Ford-Fulkersson)

## Content

- __graphAnalysis.ipynb__ is the main notebook 
- __functions.py__ contains all the functions to analyze the graph and plot the results
